# 🌤️ Cloud-Based Information Systems

Repository for the lecture Cloud Based Information System at FH Aachen in the winter
term 2022/2023

Digitization of business processes and deriving intelligent action automatically is
one of the mega trends across all industries globally. As part of this course,
you will work in project teams and experience challenges and solution approaches firsthand
Out in the wild such teams are often
founded by the leadership to act fast and avoid the internal barriers that slow down change.

Ultimate success of those newly developed ideas then depends on the
organizational willingness to embrace the new direction. But first things first.

`"what's the harm of collecting invoices manually and also typing them into your Enterprise
-Resource-Planning system manually after all?"`

There are multiple studies and reports on automation impacts on human labor.
We are quoting just two to make the point: According to the
[Smartsheet report](https://www.smartsheet.com/content-center/product-news/automation/workers-waste-quarter-work-week-manual-repetitive-tasks)
knowledge workers could save almost a full working day per week if their
repetitive tasks were automated. What could you do with an extra day?
[McKinsey's featured insight](https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/artificial-intelligence/five-fifty-fear-fear-not)
addresses the fear of automation destroying jobs and freeing the most creative
force from repetitive manual tasks in the business to work on challenges it
was built for by millions of years of evolution: the human brain 🧠.

You will be using Microsoft tooling and the most-widely adopted ERP globally - which is SAP.

💺buckle up and get your fellow humans that extra day to work on challenges, be
outdoors to get fresh ideas, socialize with colleagues, work only 4 days a
week and still get their work done or just for the sake of advancing modern work.

## 🎓 What you should already know

- Overview and processes in ERP systems (cf. [SAP in der Praxis](https://drumm.sh/sap) & [Business Information Systems](https://drumm.sh/bis))
- At least one programming language ([Python MOOC](https://open.sap.com/courses/python1))
- Basic knowledge of HTML and HTTP ([W3C HTML Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp),
  [W3C What is HTTP](https://www.w3schools.com/whatis/whatis_http.asp))
- Process Modelling ([BPMN](https://drumm.sh/is))

## 🚀 Getting started

In order to work through the learning resources provided in the next section create the following accounts:

1.  Sign-up with the [M365 Developer Program](https://developer.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/dev-program) to get
    access to your required sandbox landscape. This is a two step process:
    a. Sign up to the developer account using your university acount (https://learn.microsoft.com/office/developer-program/microsoft-365-developer-program)

        b. Add a Microsoft 365 developer subscription (https://learn.microsoft.com/office/developer-program/microsoft-365-developer-program-get-started)

> **Warning** - It is _not_ possible to reuse the Microsoft 365 subscription provided by the university.
> This subscription is very limited and missing most of the services required for the lectrure. Therefor the usage of the
> [M365 Developer Program](https://developer.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/dev-program) is recommended.

> **Warning** - once you signed-up to the M365 sandbox with your university account,
> you need to switch user and continue working with one of the supplied demo users (
> e.g. NestorW@M365x11111.onmicrosoft.com).

2. Create a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account to collaborate with your team and
   present your project to the community
3. Create your [Azure free trial for students](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/students/)
   account to get free access to Azure services without the need for credit card info.

> **Warning** - Access to SAP systems for prototyping projects is often a challenge🏋
>
> 1. Consider using SAP's "offline" [mock server](https://sap.github.io/cloud-s4-sdk-book/pages/mock-odata.html)
>    to start developing right away while you wait for the "real" systems to come available.
> 2. Explore the [SAP API Business Hub Sandbox](https://api.sap.com/api/API_BUSINESS_PARTNER/overview)
>    for an even richer set of mock services. Sign up for a P-User on the SAP community
>    to be able use "try out". Click `Login` -> `Register` from the Hub.
