# üå§Ô∏èCloud-Based Information Systems

Repository for the lecture Cloud Based Information System at FH Aachen in the winter term 2022/2023

Digitization of business processes and deriving intelligent action automatically is one of the mega trends across all industries globally. As part of this course, you will experience challenges and solution approaches firsthand acting as the incubation team üê£ of the Contoso Inc. Out in the wild such teams are often founded by the leadership to act fast and avoid the internal barriers that slow down change.

Ultimate success of those newly developed ideas then depends on the organizational willingness to embrace the new direction. But first things first.

`"what's the harm of collecting invoices manually and typing them into your Enterprise-Resource-Planning system manually after all?"`

There are multiple studies and reports on automation impacts on human labor. We are quoting just two to make the point: According to the [Smartsheet report](https://www.smartsheet.com/content-center/product-news/automation/workers-waste-quarter-work-week-manual-repetitive-tasks) knowledge workers could save almost a full working day per week if their repetitive tasks were automated. What could you do with an extra day? [McKinsey's featured insight](https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/artificial-intelligence/five-fifty-fear-fear-not) addresses the fear of automation destroying jobs and freeing the most creative force from repetitive manual tasks in the business to work on challenges it was built for by millions of years of evolution: the human brain üß†.

You will be using Microsoft tooling and the most-widely adopted ERP globally which is SAP.

üí∫buckle up and get your fellow humans that extra day to work on challenges, be outdoors to get fresh ideas, socialize with colleagues, work only 4 days a week and still get their work done or just for the sake of advancing modern work.

## üéØChallenges

- Digitize physical invoices (have a look at [this blog post](https://blogs.sap.com/2021/02/03/your-sap-on-azure-part-26-automate-invoice-processing-using-azure-logic-apps-and-cognitive-services/) from the SAP community for inspiration)
- Enable end-users to easily interact with the invoice data entry process
- Integrate your invoice recognition software with SAP S/4HANA
- Add a simple approval process into the workflow
- Infuse a smart component that detects invoice anomalies hinting at invoice fraud (you would not imagine how many fraudulent invoices get paid by companies just by sending a nice looking pdf with the right amount of money. Have a look at these insights from [Barclays](https://www.barclayscorporate.com/insights/fraud-protection/invoice-fraud/) and [this unofficial source](https://fraud.net/n/fake-invoices-three-major-cases-of-invoice-fraud-in-2020/) for context)

## ü§îWhat else?

During your project you will get guidance and mentorship not only from your professor but also from Microsoft and SAP architects. How cool is that?ü§Øüòµ
